# Linear Regression
In machine learning linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables, assuming a linear relationship. It finds the best-fitting straight line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) that minimizes the differences between predicted and actual values. This line can then be used to predict future values of the dependent variable based on new input values of the independent variable(s).

# Learning Objectives

Read a .csv file into a pandas DataFrame.
Explore a dataset with Python visualization libraries.
Experiment with different features to build a linear regression model.
Tune the model's hyperparameters.
Compare training runs using root mean squared error and loss curves.
Dataset Description
The dataset for this exercise is derived from the City of Chicago Taxi Trips dataset. The data for this exercise is a subset of the Taxi Trips data, and focuses on a two-day period in May of 2022.
